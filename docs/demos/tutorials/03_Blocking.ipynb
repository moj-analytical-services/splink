    "# Choosing blocking rules to optimise runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To link records, we need to compare pairs of records, and decide which pairs are matches and non matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most large datasets, it is computationally intractable to compare every row with every other row, since the number of comparisons rises quadratically with the number of records.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we rely on blocking rules, which specify which pairwise comparisons to generate.  For example, we could generate the subset of pairwise comparisons where either first name or surname matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is part of a two step process to link data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Use blocking rules to generate candidate pairwise record comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Use a probabilistic linkage model to score these candidate pairs, to determine which ones should be linked\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blocking rules are the most important determinant of the performance of your linkage job**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When deciding on your blocking rules, you're trading off accuracy for performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your rules are too loose, your linkage job may fail.  \n",
    "- If they're too tight, you may miss some valid links. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Blocking rules in Splink\n",
    "\n",
    "In Splink, blocking rules are specified as SQL expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to generate the subset of record comparisons where the first name matches, we can specify the following blocking rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "`l.first_name = r.first_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since blocking rules are SQL expressions, they can be arbitrarily complex.  For example, you could create record comparisons where the initial of the first name and the surname match with the following rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "`substr(l.first_name, 1,1) = substr(r.first_name, 1,1) and l.surname = r.surname`\n",
    "\n"

    "## Devising effective blocking rules \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The aims of your blocking rules are twofold:\n",
    "1. Eliminate enough non-matching comparison pairs so your record linkage job is small enough to compute\n",
    "2. Eliminate as few truly matching pairs as possible (ideally none)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is usually impossible to find a single blocking rule which achieves both aims, so we recommend using multiple blocking rules.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we specify multiple blocking rules, Splink will generate all comparison pairs that meet any one of the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following blocking rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "`l.first_name = r.first_name and l.dob = r.dob`\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule is likely to be effective in reducing the number of comparison pairs.  It will retain all truly matching pairs, except those with errors or nulls in either the `first_name` or `dob` fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider a second blocking rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "`l.email and r.email`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will retain all truly matching pairs, except those with errors or nulls in the `email` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Individually, these blocking rules are problematic because they exclude true matches where the records contain typos of certain types.  But between them, they might do quite a good job.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For a true match to be eliminated by the use of these two blocking rules, it would have to have an error in _both_  email AND (first name or date of birth).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not completely implausible, but it is significantly less likely than if we'd just used a single rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, we can often specify multiple blocking rules such that it becomes highly implausible that a true match would not meet at least one of these blocking critera.  This is the recommended approach in Splink.  Generally we would recommend between about 3 and 10, though even more is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question then becomes how to choose what to put in this list.\n"
