For instance, if the entity type is persons, you may have columns for full name, date of birth, and city. If the entity type is companies, you could have columns for name, turnover, sector, and telephone number.</p> <p>High correlation occurs when the value of a column is highly constrained (predictable) from the value of another column. For example, a 'city' field is almost perfectly correlated with 'postcode'. Gender is highly correlated with 'first name'. Correlation is particularly problematic if all of your input columns are highly correlated.</p> <p>Splink is not designed for linking a single column containing a 'bag of words'.

For instance you may have a <code>forename</code> column in your data, but when comparing records you may wish to also use the values in this column transformed all to lowercase, or just the first three letters of the name, or perhaps both of these transformations taken together.</p> <p>If it is feasible to do so, then it may be best to derive a new column containing the transformed data. Particularly if it is an expensive calculation, or you wish to refer to it many times, deriving the column once on your input data may well be preferable, as it is cheaper than doing so directly in comparisons where each input record may need to be processed many times. However, there may be situations where you don't wish to derive a new column, perhaps for large data where you have many such transformations, or when you are experimenting with different models.</p> <p>This is where a <code>ColumnExpression</code> may be used. It represents some SQL expression, which may be a column, or some more complicated construct, to which you can also apply zero or more transformations. These are lazily evaluated, and in particular will not be tied to a specific SQL dialect until they are put (via settings into a linker). This can be particularly useful if you want to write code that can easily be switched between different backends.</p> Term frequency adjustments <p>One caveat to using a <code>ColumnExpression</code> is that it cannot be combined with term frequency adjustments. Term frequency adjustments can only be computed on the raw values in a column prior to any function transforms.</p> <p>If you wish to use term frequencies with transformations of an input column, you must pre-compute a new column in your input data with the transforms applied, instead of a <code>ColumnExpression</code>.</p> <pre><code>from splink import ColumnExpression\n\nemail_lowercase = ColumnExpression(\"email\").lower()\ndob_as_string = ColumnExpression(\"dob\").cast_to_string()\nsurname_initial_lowercase = ColumnExpression(\"surname\").substr(1, 1).lower()\nentry_date = ColumnExpression(\"entry_date_str\").try_parse_date(date_format=\"YYYY-MM-DD\")\nfull_name_lowercase = ColumnExpression(\"first_name || ' ' || surname\").lower()\n</code></pre> <p>You can use a <code>ColumnExpression</code> in most places where you might also use a simple column name, such as in a library comparison, a library comparison level, or in a blocking rule:</p> <pre><code>from splink import block_on\nimport splink.comparison_library as cl\nimport splink.comparison_level_library as cll\n\nfull_name_lower_br = block_on(full_name_lowercase)\n\nemail_comparison = cl.DamerauLevenshteinAtThresholds(email_lowercase, distance_threshold_or_thresholds=[1, 3])\nentry_date_comparison = cl.AbsoluteTimeDifferenceAtThresholds(\n    entry_date,\n    input_is_string=False,\n    metrics=[\"day\", \"day\"],\n    thresholds=[1, 10],\n)\nname_comparison = cl.CustomComparison(\n    comparison_levels=[\n        cll.NullLevel(full_name_lowercase),\n        cll.ExactMatch(full_name_lowercase),\n        cll.ExactMatch(\"surname\")\n        cll.ExactMatch(\"first_name\"),\n        cll.ExactMatch(surname_initial_lowercase),\n        cll.ElseLevel()\n    ],\n    output_column_name=\"name\",\n)\n</code></pre>","tags":["API","comparisons","blocking"]},{"location":"api_docs/column_expression.html#columnexpression","title":"<code>ColumnExpression</code>","text":"<p>Enables transforms to be applied to a column before it's passed into a comparison level.</p> <p>Dialect agnostic.

This is because the final results are influenced by many other factors in the pipeline, which were intentionally excluded from this process to isolate the bias. </p> <p>Further investigation is needed to understand impact \u2014 such as understanding how many records in the input data undergo these changes, or how many records with a full surname and postcode change end up linked or not linked in the final data. </p>"},{"location":"demos/examples/duckdb_no_test/business_rates_match.html","title":"Linking businesses","text":""},{"location":"demos/examples/duckdb_no_test/business_rates_match.html#matching-businesses","title":"Matching businesses","text":"<p>In this example we attempt to match open business rates data from Stockport (source) with Companies House data (source).</p> <p>This is quite a challenging scenario because the data is not initially well suited for Splink.</p> <p>First, there are only three columns to match on:</p> <ul> <li>The business name</li> <li>The address</li> <li>The business postcode</li> </ul> <p>Second, the data itself is quite different to many other applications: the business name is an ordered 'bag of words'.</p> <p>We will therefore need to use a few preprocessing tricks to build a successful matching model/</p> <p>Let's start by taking a look at the data. To make the size of these files manageable, I have selected only rows from the companies house data where <code>substr(postcode, 1,4)</code> matches at least one postcode in the Stockport data, resulting in:</p> <ul> <li>Companies house data is around 1 million records</li> <li>Stockport data has 4,540 records</li> </ul> <p>In this example, to make it easy to understand, I break the calculation into multiple steps.

They're particularly applicable if you're working with large datasets, where you can get slowed down by long processing times.</p> <p>In a nutshell, we recommend beginning with a small sample and a basic model, then iteratively adding complexity to resolve issues and improve performance.</p>"},{"location":"demos/tutorials/08_building_your_own_model.html#general-workflow","title":"General workflow","text":"<ul> <li> <p>For large datasets, start by linking a small non-random sample of records. Building a model is an iterative process of writing data cleaning code, training models, finding issues, and circling back to fix them. You don't want long processing times slowing down this iteration cycle.</p> <p>Most of your code can be developed against a small sample of records, and only once that's working, re-run everything on the full dataset.</p> <p>You need a non-random sample of perhaps about 10,000 records. The same must be  non-random because it must retain lots of matches - for instance, retain all people aged over 70, or all people with a first name starting with the characters <code>pa</code>.  You should aim to be able to run your full training and prediction script in less than a minute.</p> <p>Remember to set a lower value (say <code>1e6</code>) of the <code>target_rows</code> when calling <code>estimate_u_using_random_sampling()</code> during this iteration process, but then increase in the final full-dataset run to a much higher value, maybe <code>1e8</code>, since large value of <code>target_rows</code> can cause long processing times even on relatively small datasets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Start with a simple model.  It's often tempting to start by designing a complex model, with many granular comparison levels in an attempt to reflect the real world closely.</p> <p>Instead, we recommend starting with with a simple, rough and ready model where most comparisons have 2-3 levels (exact match, possibly a fuzzy level, and everything else).  The idea is to get to the point of looking at prediction results as quickly as possible using e.g. the comparison viewer.  You can then start to look for where your simple model is getting it wrong, and use that as the basis for improving your model, and iterating until you're seeing good results.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"demos/tutorials/08_building_your_own_model.html#blocking-rules-for-prediction","title":"Blocking rules for prediction","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Analyse the number of comparisons before running predict.

Whilst individually, strict blocking rules are likely to exclude many true matches, between them it should be implausible that a truly matching record 'falls through' all the rules.  Many strict rules often result in far fewer overall comparisons and a small number of loose rules.  In practice, many of our real-life models have between about 10-15 <code>blocking_rules_for_prediction</code>.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"demos/tutorials/08_building_your_own_model.html#em-trainining","title":"EM trainining","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Predictions usually aren't very sensitive to <code>m</code> probabilities being a bit wrong.  The hardest model parameters to estimate are the <code>m</code> probabilities.  It's fairly common for Expectation Maximisation to yield 'bad' (implausble) values.  Luckily, the accuracy of your model is usually not particularly sensitive to the <code>m</code> probabilities - it usually the <code>u</code> probabilities driving the biggest match weights.  If you're having problems, consider fixing some <code>m</code> probabilities by expert judgement - see here for how.</p> </li> <li> <p>Convergence problems are often indicative of the need for further data cleaning.  Whilst predictions often aren't terribly sensitive to <code>m</code> probabilities, question why the estimation procedue is producing bad parameter estimates.  To do this, it's often enough to look at a variety of predictions to see if you can spot edge cases where the model is not doing what's expected.  For instance, we may find matches where the first name is <code>Mr</code>.  By fixing this and reestimating, the parameter estimates often make more sense.</p> </li> <li> <p>Blocking rules for EM training do not need high recall.  The purpose of blocking rules for EM training is to find a subset of records which include a reasonably balanced mix of matches and non matches.  There is no requirement that these records contain all, or even most of the matches.

Again <code>dialect</code> is passed as a parameter, and the test will run in turn for each value of <code>dialect</code> except for <code>sqlite</code>. <p>If you need to exclude multiple dialects this is also possible - just pass each as an argument.

It turns out that this is good enough to get good estimates of the other parameters, and ultimatey to get good predictions.</p> <p>In our methodology,  the user specifies a list of deterministic matching rules that they believe represent true matches.

It would work if we had infinite computing resources and could create unlimited numbers of comparisons.
